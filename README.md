# Melody generation model

This project contains:
- an AI capable of generating tune in ABC notation;
- tools used to train this model;
- a web application for composing tunes with help of artificial intelligence.

### Examples of tunes generated by the model
In "data_out/generated_melody_examles" directory there have been saved several tunes generated by the model. In "abc" subdirectory tunes are saved in ABC notation. In "audio" subdirectory synthesised tunes have been saved.


### Prerequisites
- [FluidSynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/Download)
- [MuseScore3](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/download-and-installation)


### Installing dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Running the application
To start an application run "run_app.py" script from the project directory and open the displayed link in a browser of your choice.
```
$ ./run_app.py
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

### Training the model
To start training the model run "run_training.py" script from the project directory. It will start trainig with default configuration. Training output will be stored in a new subdirectory of the "outputs" directory.
```
$ ./run_training.py
```
Default training configuration is defined in "config/abcrnn.yaml". Run:
```
$ ./run_training.py -h
```
to learn how to overwrite default configuration.
